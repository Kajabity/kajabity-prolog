Kajabity Prolog
===============

A Prolog interpreter written in Java just for fun!

This is a small implementation of the Prolog language that I wrote for fun some time in 2003/4.  It's the 2nd time as
I lost the first version earlier that year and so started again - this time backed up to source control.

It isn't intended to compete with any other Prolog implementations, but is rather to be used as a lerning excercise for
me and to provide code examples for my AI Explained articles on Kajabity.com.

It's still a work in progress and will likely be for some time.

Comments and contributions are welcome.

Enjoy!
